# Ev3 Tracked Explorer Mark II
The Ev3 Tracked Explorer Mark II is a rover built with Lego Mindstorms Ev3 and Lego Technic parts. I've replaced the firmware running on the Ev3 brick with [ev3dev](https://www.ev3dev.org) firmware, which let you program the Ev3 brick with Python (among other prossible choices).

Main features of the Ev3 Tracked Explorer Mark II **vehicle**:
- N.2 Ev3 Large Motors for driving
- N.1 Ev3 Medium Motor to rotate the *head*
- N.1 Ev3 Infrared sensor mounted on the rotating head to scan the envirnoment for obstacles

Main features of the Ev3 Tracked Explorer Mark II **software**:
- The rover can be controlled from a desktop app running on a Windows PC
- The rover streams sensor and motors telemetry to the desktop app
